Glaucoma is a group of eye  conditions that damage the  optical  whim-whams, which is  pivotal for good vision. It  frequently occurs when fluid builds up in the  frontal part of the eye,  adding  pressure inside the eye and damaging the  optical  whim-whams. Existing approaches such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Visual Field Testing (VFT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) have some disadvantages like it being expensive, time consuming, high computational complexity, being sensitive to noisy data. This Project suggests a hybrid method employing CNN and BiLSTM that overcomes the limitations of competing techniques and yields more accurate results. Also, the proposed method is compared with accuracies of different classifiers similar as SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes Gaussian, Naïve Bayes Multinomial, Decision Trees. Through this comparative analysis, this project aims to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different classification techniques, facilitating the selection of the most suitable approach for glaucoma diagnosis.
